  "description": "Synth Trainer is aimed to be an ear trainer for beginner electronic music producers. The goal of the application is to train artists to recognize sounds by their timbre and characteristics so that they can recreate sounds from their favorite songs or fleeting ideas that they may not have been able to create before. Using Synth Trainer, people will develop the ability to recognize the sounds of basic waveforms (sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth) and also know the general ADSR values needed to create plucked instruments, pads, etc.",
